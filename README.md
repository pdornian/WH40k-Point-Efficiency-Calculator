# WH40k-Point-Efficiency-Calculator v3.2d
Excel sheet for computing expected damage and point efficiency in Warhammer 40k 8th edition

'WH40k Point Efficiency Calculator.xlsx' is the main file. Download it and open it with Excel. 
It is a blank sheet that is meant for you to input your units. See 'user manual.docx' for instructions.

There is a Google Sheets version, but I recommend the regular one.

If you are looking for already filled out sheets, there are some in 'Army Examples'.
